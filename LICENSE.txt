    The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle

    this file.

    Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
    copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
    not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
    intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
    the actual statements in the files are controlling.

    * Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
      and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
      at the bottom of this file.

    * The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
      a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
      files for details:
       libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
       libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c

    * The following source files are in the public domain:

       libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c

    * The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
      and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
      widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
      distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

    I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
    time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
    do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
    seems to be an unavoidable mess.

lzma:

    https://tukaani.org/xz/
    
    liblzma is a public domain general-purpose data compression library with
    zlib-like API. The native file format is .xz, but also the old .lzma
    format and raw (no headers) streams are supported. Multiple compression
    algorithms (filters) are supported. Currently LZMA2 is the primary filter.

    liblzma is part of XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>. XZ Utils includes
    a gzip-like command line tool named xz and some other tools. XZ Utils
    is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin.

    Major parts of liblzma are based on Igor Pavlov's public domain LZMA SDK
    <http://7-zip.org/sdk.html>.

    The SHA-256 implementation is based on the public domain code found from
    7-Zip <http://7-zip.org/>, which has a modified version of the public
    domain SHA-256 code found from Crypto++ <http://www.cryptopp.com/>.
    The SHA-256 code in Crypto++ was written by Kevin Springle and Wei Dai.

SVG icons from icons8.com:

    Contribution by Manuel Brotz, https://github.com/mbrotz/qlZipInfo
    
    I asked for and received permission from icons8 to use their icons in this
    project. Please note that these icons were purchased using a subscription
    to icons8 and you are not allowed to use them in your own projects whithout
    purchasing them from icons8 yourself!
    
    This question was posted to the questions section at
    https://icons8.com/pricing on 04/09/2024.

        Hi. I paid for one month and downloaded 6 icons in svg format. I now
        cancelled my subscription. Am i allowed to use these 6 icons in an open
        source project, where the svg source would be accessible in a public
        source code repository on github? I can include the a link to icon8.

    Alex 04/10/2024

        You can use the downloaded icons in your open-source project. However, you
        must inform your users that they're not allowed to use our icons as is in
        their own projects.

    Manuel Brotz 04/11/2024

        That is great! Thank you so much! I will add a disclaimer and a link to
        icons8 in the source code and the readme!
