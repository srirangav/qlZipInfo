libarchive:

    The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle
    and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of
    this file.

    Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
    copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
    not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
    intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
    the actual statements in the files are controlling.

    * Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
      and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
      at the bottom of this file.

    * The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
      a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
      files for details:
       libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
       libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
       libarchive/mtree.5

    * The following source files are in the public domain:
       libarchive/archive_getdate.c

    * The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to
      choose from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:
       libarchive/archive_blake2.h
       libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h
       libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c
       libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c

    * The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
      and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
      widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
      distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

    I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
    time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
    do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
    seems to be an unavoidable mess.

lzma:

    https://tukaani.org/xz/
    
    liblzma is a public domain general-purpose data compression library with
    zlib-like API. The native file format is .xz, but also the old .lzma
    format and raw (no headers) streams are supported. Multiple compression
    algorithms (filters) are supported. Currently LZMA2 is the primary filter.

    liblzma is part of XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>. XZ Utils includes
    a gzip-like command line tool named xz and some other tools. XZ Utils
    is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin.

    Major parts of liblzma are based on Igor Pavlov's public domain LZMA SDK
    <http://7-zip.org/sdk.html>.

    The SHA-256 implementation is based on the public domain code found from
    7-Zip <http://7-zip.org/>, which has a modified version of the public
    domain SHA-256 code found from Crypto++ <http://www.cryptopp.com/>.
    The SHA-256 code in Crypto++ was written by Kevin Springle and Wei Dai.
