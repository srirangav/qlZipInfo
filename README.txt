qlZipInfo v1.3

Homepage:

    https://github.com/srirangav/qlZipInfo
    
Overview:

    qlZipInfo is a QuickLook generator for zip, jar, tar,
    tar.gz (.tgz), tar.bz2 (.tbz2/.tbz), tar.Z (.tZ), xar
    (.xar, .pkg), debian (.deb), Redhat Package Manager
    (.rpm), 7zip (.7z), xz, Microsoft cabinet (.cab), gzip
    (.gz), lha, Binhex 4.0 (.hqx), Stuffit (.sit), and
    CrossOvers (.cxarchive) archives, IPSW files, and
    ISO9660 (.iso, .cdr, .toast) images.

    qlZipInfo relies on libarchive (https://libarchive.org/).

    Information for each file in an archive is displayed in
    the following format:

        Icon | Filename | Size | Permissions | Date Modified

    A folder icon is shown for folders / directories, a file
    icon is shown for regular files, and a lock icon is shown
    for encypted files.  In addition, for BinHex 4.0 archives,
    a package icon is shown if the file stored in the archive
    is a Stuffit archive and an application icon is shown if
    the file stored in the archive is an application.

    After listing information for all the files in an archive,
    a summary rows is shown with the number of files in the
    archive, the archive's total uncompressed size, the
    archive's total compressed size and the % compression.

    For BinHex 4.0 files, the date modified and the summary
    row are omitted. Instead the MacOS type and creator are
    shown.

Install:

    1. Create the directory ~/Library/QuickLook if it doesn't
       exist

    2. Copy qlZipInfo.qlgenerator to ~/Library/QuickLook

    3. Restart QuickLook:

       /usr/bin/qlmanage -r
       /usr/bin/qlmanage -r cache

    4. Wait a minute or two for QuickLook to properly load
       or reload qlZipInfo.qlgenerator

    Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) users can install qlZipInfo
    using `iloveitaly/tap/qlzipinfo`.

Supported MacOSX versions:

    v. 1.2.0 and onwards - 10.13+
    v. 1.0.9 - 1.1.11    - 10.9+
    v. 1.0.8 and earlier - 10.6+

Known Issues:

    1. If WinZip is installed (for example, as part of Roxio
       Toast), this quicklook generator will not produce a
       preview for zip files because Quicklook always prefers
       generators that are included in an application and
       there is no way to override this behavior without
       editing WinZip.  Similarly, if Suspicious Package is
       installed, this quicklook generator will not produce a
       preview for .pkg files. See:

       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11705425

    2. Unix Compress'ed tar files with the extension .tz or
       .tZ cannot be reliabily detected and previewed

    3. InstallSheild CAB files are not currently supported

    4. Only BinHex 4.0 files are supported

    5. Stuffit 5 files are not currently supported
